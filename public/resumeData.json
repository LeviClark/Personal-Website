    "bio":"I grew up on a pig farm in LaCygne, Kansas. I didn't have much experience with programming when I got to college, as I originally wanted to go for Computer Animation, so I got pretty lucky when I realized I loved it and it was a much more practical career to pursue. When I'm not busy with school, I'm probably hanging out with my Fiancee (I'm getting married in June!) and our two dogs, Tofu and Jenny. My Fiancee and I are both pretty big into fitness (we actually met at the KU Rec Center), so we enjoy working out together. I also recently got into Warhammer Tabletop. I enjoy the painting side of the hobby the most, as it's a nice relaxing hobby after a long day.",
