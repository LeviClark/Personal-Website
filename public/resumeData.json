    "bio":"I grew up on a pig farm in LaCygne, Kansas. I didn't have much experience with programming when I got to college (there aren't many programming classes offered in small town high school), so I got pretty lucky when I realized how much I enjoy it. I'm currently working as a software engineer at i3 in Huntsville, Alabama. At i3, we contract with the military and help create training apps for new pilots in the Army. When I'm not busy with work, I'm probably hanging out with my Wife (Jessica), and our two dogs, Tofu and Jenny. We're also excited to announce that we are expecting in May 2020!",
